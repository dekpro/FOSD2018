                            <h3 class="tm-gold-text tm-title">Motivation</h3>
                            <p class="tm-margin-b-30">Feature orientation is an emerging paradigm of software
							development. It not only supports the automatic generation
							of large-scale software systems from a set of units of functionality,
							called features, but also allows to reason about systems properties
							in terms of such features. The original idea of feature-oriented software
							development (FOSD) is to explicitly represent similarities and
							differences of a family of software systems for a given application
							domain (e.g., database systems, banking software, text processing
							systems) with the goal of reusing software artifacts among the family
							members. Moreover, features (as first-class entities) have shown to
							be beneficial in recent past for software analysis, as they allow to
							consider different properties in a more cohesive way (apart from lowlevel
							language constructs). A feature is a unit of functionality that
							satisfies a requirement, represents a design decision, and provides
							a potential configuration option. As such, it allows to distinguish
							different members of the family by their variable parts. A challenge
							in FOSD is that a feature does not map cleanly to an isolated module
							of code. Rather, it may affect (“cut across”) many components/artifacts
							of a software system. Furthermore, the decomposition of a
							software system into its features gives rise to a combinatorial explosion
							of possible feature combinations and interactions. Research on
							FOSD has shown that the concept of features pervades all phases of
							the software life cycle and requires a proper treatment in terms of
							analysis, design, and programming techniques, methods, languages,
							and tools, as well as formalisms and theory.</p>

                            <h3 class="tm-gold-text tm-title">Goals</h3>
                            <p class="tm-margin-b-30">The primary goal of the Ninth International Workshop
							on Feature-Oriented Software Development (FOSD) is to foster
							and strengthen the collaboration between researchers who work in
							the field of FOSD or in the related fields of software product lines,
							service-oriented architecture, model-driven engineering and feature
							interactions. The focus of FOSD’18 will be on discussions, rather
							than on presenting technical content only.</p>

                            <h3 class="tm-gold-text tm-title">Workshop Format</h3>
                            <p class="tm-margin-b-30">The workshop will be a highly interactive
							event for one full day. The opener will be a keynote by a speaker
							relevant to the FOSD community (TBD). Then, accepted papers are
							presented in sessions. For each accepted paper, we allocate 10–15
							min for presentation (depending on number of presentations) and
							3–5 min clarification questions. Then, at the end of each session,
							there will be a panel discussion (approx. 30 min) with all speakers
							of this session.</p>
                            
							<p>Additionally, we will allocate one slot for a discussion sessions
							to address issues raised during the paper presentations or other “hot
							topics". The ultimate goal of this session is to join forces and, in
							summary, obtain a kind of manifesto of FOSD reflecting on the main
							challenges and future directions for research in the field of FOSD.
							</p>
							
							<p><i><b>Tool Demos.</b></i> To make the FOSD workshop an interactive event
							we also allocate a session informal discussion and demonstrations.
							We thus want to encourage you to prepare a demonstration related
							to FOSD or think about topics you ever wanted to discuss.

                            <h3 class="tm-gold-text tm-title">Submission</h3>
                            <p class="tm-margin-b-30">We invite submissions 2 to 8 pages long in ACM
							proceedings format. Submissions must follow the <a href='https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template'>ACM proceedings format</a>, 
							similar to the SPLC submission guidline (see <a href='http://splc2018.net/call-for-papers/call-for-research-papers/'>here</a> for more details).  
							
					
							
							The papers will be reviewed by at least three
							members of the program committee. The authors will be notified
							about acceptance before the early registration deadline. Accepted
							papers will be posted on the website and published in the ACM
							Digital Library. In particular, we are looking for contributions in
							the following topics:</p>
                            
							 <ul>
								<li>Programming language and tool support for FOSD</li>
								<li>Formal methods and theory for FOSD</li>
								<li>Variability-aware analysis (e.g., testing, type checking, dataflow analysis, and verification)</li>
								<li>Feature composition and refactoring</li>
								<li>Detection and handling of feature interactions</li>
								<li>Versioning, evolution, and maintenance</li>
								<li>Reverse engineering variability</li>
								<li>Re-engineering, e.g., to model-driven SPLs or featureoriented architectures</li>
								<li>Generative programming and automatic programming</li>
								<li>Components, services, and models
								<li>Build systems and feature-to-code mappings</li>
								<li>Feature modeling concepts and languages</li>
								<li>Program comprehension (e.g., modularization, visualization, searching, tools and interfaces)</li>
								<li>Empirical studies of all these topics</li>
							</ul> 

							<p class="tm-margin-b-30">Papers should exhibit originality and should not present already
							finished research. Instead, we explicitly invite papers that present
							new, visionary ideas that are in an early stage with some questions
							still being open. In particular, the papers should highlight:</p>
							
							<ul>
								<li>What is the problem and why?</li>
								<li>What are the challenges in solving this problem?</li>
								<li>What is the idea of the proposed approach/technique/method, process, etc. and why it is worth to consider?</li>
								<li>What my hinder success of the proposed approach (i.e., why it may fail)?</li>
